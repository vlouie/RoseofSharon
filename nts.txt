Notes to self:
=============
[ ] fix order preview for multi-word categories (high style, etc.)
[ ] wtf is wrong with order form??
[ ] confirmation/success page for orders
[ ] content
--> index
--> order success page
--> weddings
[ ] add loader images?
--> to table retrieval GET?
--> to large resize lightbox?
--> on success hide it? on click, show it?
[ ] wait on email for Weddings

Possible future endeavours:
==========================
[ ] SQL database (only if there are a great number of products & there is a schema that makes sense)
[ ] PHP shopping cart for products (depends on userbase and number of products; not sure if nature of product lends itself to this)
