Notes to self:
=============
[ ] confirmation/success page for orders
[x] fix pageView sizing (view.js)
--> if scrollbar (doc.height > window.height) then pageView.width - 20px (1660px instead of 1680px)
[ ] content
--> index
--> order success page
--> holidays
--> weddings
[ ] add loader images?
--> to table retrieval GET?
--> to large resize lightbox?
--> on success hide it? on click, show it?
[x] fix scaling/green background
[x] rose of sharon watermark on left to replace current flower
[x] increase size of logo
[x] increase font size (mobile especially!!!!!)
[x] wider top nav bar
[ ] wait on email for Weddings
[x] bigger slideshow pic
[x] fix scaling for mobile (tablet esp)

Possible future endeavours:
==========================
[ ] SQL database (only if there are a great number of products & there is a schema that makes sense)
[ ] PHP shopping cart for products (depends on userbase and number of products; not sure if nature of product lends itself to this)
