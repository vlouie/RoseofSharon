Notes to self:
=============
[x] fix up table generation js (have 1 function take in the table? based on table id -- to be fixed -- use corresponding csv file & use it)
[x] dummy csv's
[x] FIX BROKEN IMAGES GRRRRR
[x] photoshop cup out of corsage picture -.-
[x] add X to lightbox for close?--> too many logistics to think about; compromise with some text
[ ] ORDER FORM MAGIC
[x] table content styling
[x] consistent button CSS (use class .button for order buttons + input on orderform)
[x] lightbox on img click
[x] fix slideshow
[ ] content
[x] use subtle pattern for background???
[ ] add loader images?
--> to table retrieval GET?
--> to large resize lightbox?
--> on success hide it? on click, show it?

Possible future endeavours:
==========================
[ ] SQL database (only if there are a great number of products & there is a schema that makes sense)
[ ] PHP shopping cart for products (depends on userbase and number of products; not sure if nature of product lends itself to this)
