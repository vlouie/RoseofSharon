Notes to self:
=============
[ ] check iPad picture for positioning
[x] center logo above menu
[ ] mini "Rose of Sharon" bottom right contact page (signature)
[ ] seal (watermark = pink, small, right bottom corner)
[ ] another watermark (below menu)
[x] move watermark up behind menu
[x] animate banners
[x] put in more accurate image for homepage wedding button
[ ] wait on email for Weddings
[x] fix order preview for multi-word categories (high style, etc.)
[x] wtf is wrong with order form??
[x] fix lightbox image size
[ ] confirmation/success page for orders
[ ] content
--> order success page
- create it
--> weddings
- more pictures

Possible future endeavours:
==========================
[ ] SQL database (only if there are a great number of products & there is a schema that makes sense)
[ ] PHP shopping cart for products (depends on userbase and number of products; not sure if nature of product lends itself to this)
[ ] add loader images?
--> to table retrieval GET?
--> to large resize lightbox?
--> on success hide it? on click, show it?
